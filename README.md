# ERC721 Wallet

## Motivation

There are many ERC721 wallets out there already, but none that work truely
permissionless in the sense that any ERC721 can be added. This wallet's aim is
to allow any ERC721 be transferred with Metamask and eventually Ledger or
Trezor.


## Installation

```
$ git clone git@github.com:TimDaub/ERC721-wallet.git
$ npm i
$ npm run dev
```
